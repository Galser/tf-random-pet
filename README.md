# Resource "random-pet" of random provider

In general "random" provider allows the use of randomness within Terraform configurations. This is a logical provider, which means that it works entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other services. It comes with several resources and in in this specific repo we going to show the `random_pet` resource.

For details about other resource and demo usage see [this repo](https://github.com/Galser/tf-random)
